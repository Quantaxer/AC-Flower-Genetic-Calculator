# Tulip Hackday Project

At my workplace, we have a quarterly hackday which allows everyone to work on a project that they  find interesting and want to learn about. This can either be work projects or something on the side. As such, I decided to do more work on this project because I really want to get it finished by the end of the summer and have it be in a good state.

Currently, the basis of what it does works, but it 1: is not styled at all and 2: I;m learning React from scratch. Because of this, I have simply been following tutorials I found online, and it's quite possible that they are not the best way to go about solving the problems I am running into when working on it.

## Goals for hackday

- Learn about different ways to make react code more readable and easy to understand for a beginner
- Using templates for React to make the site styled without putting in any effort into actually making the css
- Best practices for creating new components, and how many components is "too much"

## Post-mortem for hackday

This is where once I am done developing the code for hackday, I will reflect on what I accomplished and what I failed on.
