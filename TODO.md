# Things to do

## FEATURES

1. Finish making child component
2. Add more comments and clean up variable names for my stinky code
3. Build a component to allow the user to search for certain flowers from the db
4. Maybe make a section that gets all seeded flowers from the db and their genes?
   1. Possibly a sort functionality of some kind? Like by color, flower etc
5. Make the frontend actually look good with styling
   1. Rather than the text for color, make it display actual colors
   2. Fix margins on everything
   3. Add images and backgrounds, color scheme
   4. Other general changes

## BUGS

1. Make storage persistent for db (- sql-persistence:/var/lib/mysql ???)
2. Figure out how to prevent econnreset
3. Add loading thingy while db is not available to prevent accidental no results when fetching from db
