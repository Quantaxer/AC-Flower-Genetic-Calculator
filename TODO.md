# Things to do

1. Readd - sql-persistence:/var/lib/mysql     to the compose file for persistent storage
2. Make a basic react app to call the endpoint with 2 flowers
   1. Need to convert trinary to string representation, probably through a function call on the backend
   2. See if the gene calculation is fast, right now it might be unoptimized with for loops literally everywhere. Might need to optimize it
3. Create endpoint to calculate the colors based off of the database information
4. Build a component to allow the user to search for certain flowers from the db
5. Maybe make a section that gets all seeded flowers from the db and their genes?
   1. Possibly a sort functionality of some kind? Like by color, flower etc
6. Make the frontend actually look good with styling
