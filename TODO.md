# Things to do

1. Make storage persistent for db (- sql-persistence:/var/lib/mysql ???)
2. Make things use async await and not yucky promises
3. Fix yucky indentation
4. Create endpoint to calculate the colors based off of the database information
   1. This would use the breed of flower + genetic makeup
5. Display results of calculation on webpage
6. Build a component to allow the user to search for certain flowers from the db
7. Maybe make a section that gets all seeded flowers from the db and their genes?
   1. Possibly a sort functionality of some kind? Like by color, flower etc
8. Make the frontend actually look good with styling
