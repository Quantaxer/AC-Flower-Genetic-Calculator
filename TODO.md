# Things to do

## FEATURES

1. Create endpoint to calculate the colors based off of the database information
   1. This would use the breed of flower + genetic makeup
2. Display results of calculation on webpage
3. Build a component to allow the user to search for certain flowers from the db
4. Maybe make a section that gets all seeded flowers from the db and their genes?
   1. Possibly a sort functionality of some kind? Like by color, flower etc
5. Make the frontend actually look good with styling

## BUGS

1. Make storage persistent for db (- sql-persistence:/var/lib/mysql ???)
2. Figure out how to prevent econnreset
3. Add loading thingy while db is not available to prevent accidental no results when fetching from db
